# ft_containers

The aim of this project is to understand the inner workings of the STL data structers by re-implementing them.

And also add performance improvements where possible.

# Personal Notes

This was a solo project.

Firstly I need to understand how the data structres work. I have read lots of documentations in order to understand them. The hardest part of this project was
implementing the std::map. I had to pick between the AVL-Tree and Red-Black-Tree structers and I choose Red-Black because it was more precise. The procces involved
lots of debugging and code altering to find the best performance.

For this project I had help from the STL documentation and the Electronic Arts' implemantion of STL.

In the and, this project helped me understand how useful and creative the data structures of the STL can be. I have also accomplished improving the performance in some operations.
